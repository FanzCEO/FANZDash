This policy implements payment processor requirements under the Global Brand Protection Program.\n\n**Explanation:** The content includes the term 'step-mother' in a sexual context, which falls within our prohibition on family-themed sexual content. This applies regardless of whether the content involves actual family members, as payment processors prohibit all such content.\n\n**Remedies:** You may appeal this decision within 14 days through [appeal link]. You also have the right to pursue out-of-court dispute resolution through a certified body, or pursue judicial review.'\n\n**Quality Standards:**\n- Clear, not vague\n- Specific to the content\n- Understandable to average person\n- No legal jargon without explanation\n- Includes all required elements"
