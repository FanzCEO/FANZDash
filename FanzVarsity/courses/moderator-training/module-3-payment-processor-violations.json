This module covers how to review and enforce content against Visa and Mastercard requirements.\n\n**Why Payment Processors Matter:**\nWithout payment processing, platforms cannot:\n- Accept subscriptions\n- Process tips\n- Pay creators\n- Operate as a business\n\nLosing Visa/Mastercard is essentially a death sentence for adult platforms. This is why compliance is non-negotiable.\n\n**The Global Brand Protection Program (GBPP):**\nVisa and Mastercard created GBPP after the 2020 Pornhub crisis:\n\n**Requirements:**\n1. Meaningful consent verification for all performers\n2. Content review and moderation\n3. Complaint/appeal processes\n4. Compliance with prohibited content categories\n5. Regular reporting and audits\n\n**Non-Compliance Consequences:**\n- Warning and remediation period\n- Increased transaction fees\n- Reserve requirements (holding funds)\n- Termination of processing\n- Industry-wide blacklisting\n\n**Your Role:**\nAs a moderator, you:\n- Review content flagged for potential violations\n- Assess risk scores and content\n- Make enforcement decisions\n- Process appeals\n- Document decisions for audit\n\nYour decisions directly protect the platform's ability to operate."

No exceptions.\n\n**Category 4: Bestiality**\n\nWhat to look for:\n- Any sexual content involving animals\n- Animal roleplay with realistic characteristics\n\nDecision: Any content meeting this definition → Remove immediately.\n\n**Category 5: Non-Consensual Content**\n\nWhat to look for:\n- 'Rape' or 'force' themes\n- CNC (consensual non-consent)\n- Unconscious/sleeping scenarios\n- Drugging scenarios\n- Hidden camera without visible consent\n\nDecision: Even if labeled as roleplay → Remove. Processors cannot distinguish real from fake.\n\n**Category 6: Necrophilia**\nRare but absolute prohibition. Any content depicting or simulating → Remove.\n\n**Category 7: Bodily Waste**\n\nWhat to look for:\n- Feces/excrement\n- Urine in sexual contexts\n- Vomit\n\nDecision: Content meeting this definition → Remove.\n\n**Category 8: Extreme Violence**\n\nWhat to look for:\n- Blood or blood drawing\n- Weapons in sexual contact\n- Strangulation beyond light breath play\n- Punching/kicking face/head\n- Visible injuries\n\nDecision framework:\n- Blood visible → Remove\n- Weapons in contact → Remove\n- BDSM with safety shown → Context review\n- Light breath play → Usually allow with documentation\n\n**Category 9: Trafficking**\n- Covered in Module 2\n- Escalate per trafficking procedures"

Understanding this helps you prioritize and calibrate decisions.\n\n**Score Ranges:**\n\n**0-39 (Green/Low):**\n- Generally approved automatically\n- Standard adult content\n- You may see these for spot-checks\n- Rarely requires action\n\n**40-59 (Yellow/Moderate):**\n- Flagged for review\n- May have concerning keywords\n- Needs human assessment\n- Context often clarifies\n\n**60-79 (Orange/Elevated):**\n- Priority review\n- Multiple concerning factors\n- Likely needs creator contact\n- Higher chance of violation\n\n**80-100 (Red/High):**\n- Blocked automatically\n- Clear policy indicators\n- Review for enforcement action\n- Often warrants strike\n\n**Factors Affecting Score:**\n\nINCREASES score:\n- Prohibited keywords (+20-80 depending on severity)\n- Age-related terms (+30)\n- Family terms (+80)\n- Violence keywords (+40)\n- Previous violations (+10-30)\n- New account (+10)\n- Rapid uploads (+10)\n\nDECREASES score:\n- Complete 2257 docs (-10)\n- Creator certification (-5)\n- Clean history (-10)\n- Long-term verified account (-5)\n- Clear consent documentation (-5)\n\n**Using Scores:**\n- Scores are guides, not absolutes\n- A 45-score with clear violation is still a violation\n- A 75-score with innocent context may be OK\n- Document your reasoning regardless of score\n- Consistency matters more than score"

Document category.\n   - MAYBE → Go to step 2.\n   - NO → Approve.\n\n2. **Would payment processors flag this?**\n   - Consider if you were auditing this for Visa\n   - If they'd have concerns → Remove or escalate\n   - If reasonable compliance officer would approve → Approve\n\n3. **When in doubt:**\n   - Escalate to senior moderator\n   - Don't guess on borderline cases\n   - Document your concerns\n\n**Handling Appeals:**\n\nCreators can appeal removal decisions. When processing appeals:\n\n1. **Review original decision**\n   - What was the violation?\n   - What evidence was there?\n   - Was documentation complete?\n\n2. **Review appeal content**\n   - What is creator's explanation?\n   - Did they provide additional context/documentation?\n   - Is there new information?\n\n3. **Fresh Assessment**\n   - Would you make same decision now?\n   - Is new context compelling?\n   - Is this a policy interpretation issue?\n\n4. **Decision**\n   - Uphold: Original decision stands, explain why\n   - Overturn: Restore content, clear strike if applicable\n   - Escalate: If policy clarification needed\n\n**Appeal Response Time:**\n- Standard: 24-48 hours\n- EU DSA: 14 days maximum (legal requirement)\n- Document reasoning regardless of outcome\n\n**Balancing False Positives:**\n- False positive = legitimate content flagged\n- False negative = violation missed\n- Both have costs\n- Slight bias toward caution is appropriate\n- But excessive false positives frustrate creators\n- Track your accuracy metrics"
