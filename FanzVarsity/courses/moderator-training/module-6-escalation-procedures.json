Knowing when to escalate is as important as knowing how to make decisions.\n\n**Why Escalation Matters:**\n- Some decisions exceed moderator authority\n- Some situations require specialized expertise\n- Legal implications may require legal review\n- Consistency requires senior guidance on novel issues\n- Protecting yourself and the platform\n\n**Escalation Levels:**\n\n**Level 1: Senior Moderator**\n- Complex content decisions\n- Policy interpretation questions\n- Novel situations\n- Borderline cases\n\n**Level 2: Compliance Team**\n- CSAM detections\n- Trafficking indicators (high/critical)\n- Regulatory concerns\n- GDPR/DSA complex issues\n\n**Level 3: Legal Team**\n- Potential legal action\n- Law enforcement requests\n- Media inquiries\n- Novel policy questions\n\n**Level 4: Law Enforcement**\n- CSAM (via Compliance → NCMEC)\n- Trafficking (via Compliance → FBI)\n- Immediate threats\n- Child safety concerns\n\n**Golden Rule:**\nWhen in doubt, escalate. It's better to escalate unnecessarily than to make a wrong decision on a serious matter."

        "script": "Senior moderators handle escalations from the moderation team. Know when to use them.\n\n**When to Escalate:**\n\n1. **Unclear Policy Interpretation**\n- Policy doesn't clearly address this content\n- Multiple policies might apply\n- Conflicting interpretations possible\n\n2. **Borderline Content (Risk 60-79)**\n- Could go either way\n- Need second opinion\n- Unusual context\n\n3. **Creator Disputes**\n- Creator is pushing back\n- Complex appeal\n- VIP or high-profile creator\n\n4. **Novel Situations**\n- New type of content\n- New platform feature\n- Situation not covered in training\n\n5. **Personal Discomfort**\n- Content is affecting you\n- Need a break\n- Want fresh perspective\n\n**How to Escalate:**\n\n1. Use escalation function in moderation tool\n2. Provide:\n   - Content/account identifier\n   - Your initial assessment\n   - Specific question or concern\n   - What you've already reviewed\n3. Continue with other work while awaiting response\n4. Document that you escalated and when\n\n**Response Expectations:**\n- Urgent: 2-4 hours\n- Standard: Same shift or next shift\n- Complex: 24-48 hours with acknowledgment\n\n**Learning from Escalations:**\n- Senior decision becomes guidance for similar cases\n- Ask for explanation to learn\n- Patterns may update training or policy"

Use designated escalation channels\n2. Mark urgency level (immediate, same day, routine)\n3. Provide:\n   - Full details of situation\n   - What you've done so far\n   - What decision/action is pending\n   - Any deadlines\n4. Do NOT take action on the matter until guidance received\n5.

Senior moderator on duty\n2. Compliance (emergency line)\n3. They may involve 911/emergency services\n\n**When Law Enforcement Contacts Us:**\n\nIf you receive:\n- Phone call from agent\n- Email from official address\n- Formal letter/subpoena\n\nYour response:\n1. DO NOT provide any information\n2. DO NOT confirm or deny user existence\n3. Take their contact information\n4. Escalate immediately to Legal\n5. Legal will verify and respond\n\n**Why This Process:**\n- Legal must verify legitimacy\n- Proper procedures protect evidence\n- Improper disclosure could harm investigation\n- Platform could be liable for wrong disclosure"
