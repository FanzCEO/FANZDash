        "script": "Welcome to Trafficking Indicators training. This module equips you to recognize signs of human trafficking in adult content contexts.\n\n**What is Human Trafficking?**\nHuman trafficking involves the use of force, fraud, or coercion to exploit people for labor or commercial sex. In the adult content industry, this primarily manifests as:\n\n- Forced participation in pornography\n- Coerced adult content creation\n- Third-party control over performers' work and earnings\n- Debt bondage (working to pay off 'debts')\n\n**Key Law: FOSTA-SESTA**\nThe Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) and Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA), passed in 2018:\n\n- Removed some Section 230 protections for platforms\n- Made platforms potentially liable for facilitating trafficking\n- Requires active monitoring and response\n- Creates criminal penalties for knowing facilitation\n\n**Why This Matters:**\nPlatforms that knowingly allow trafficking activity face:\n- Criminal prosecution\n- Civil liability to victims\n- Massive reputational damage\n- Platform shutdown\n\n**Your Role:**\nAs a moderator, you are trained to:\n- Recognize trafficking indicators\n- Assess risk levels\n- Escalate appropriately\n- Support evidence gathering\n- Never confront suspected traffickers\n\n**Important Note:**\nYou are NOT law enforcement. Your job is to identify, document, and escalate - not to investigate or intervene directly."

        "script": "We monitor for 13 specific indicators. Each alone may have innocent explanations, but combinations raise serious concerns.\n\n**Indicator 1: Third-Party Management/Control**\n- Someone else manages the account\n- Communications from non-performer\n- 'Manager' makes decisions\n- Performer seems scripted or coached\n\n**Indicator 2: Location Changes**\n- Content filmed in multiple cities rapidly\n- Hotel/motel backgrounds in different locations\n- IP addresses from multiple states/countries\n- Pattern suggests being moved\n\n**Indicator 3: Multiple Performers, Single Account**\n- Different people appear on one account\n- Could indicate operation rather than individual\n- Especially concerning with other indicators\n\n**Indicator 4: Pricing Anomalies**\n- Suspiciously low pricing\n- Undercuts market significantly\n- May indicate desperation or third-party control\n- Volume over value approach\n\n**Indicator 5: Coercion Language**\n- 'Have to' do this\n- 'Need money' urgently\n- References to debts\n- 'Forced' or 'made to'\n- Desperation in communications\n\n**Indicator 6: Age Ambiguity**\n- Looks younger than stated age\n- School references in recent context\n- Age verification concerns\n- Young appearance + other indicators = high risk\n\n**Indicator 7: Restricted Communication**\n- Can only communicate at certain times\n- Responses seem monitored\n- Cannot message freely\n- Sudden communication cutoffs\n\n**Indicator 8: ID Document Issues**\n- Unusual requests for ID copies\n- Concern about document location\n- Someone else holds their documents\n- Fear related to ID\n\n**Indicator 9: Cash-Only Payments**\n- Insists on cash payments\n- Avoids payment tracking\n- Unusual payment arrangements\n- Third party receives payment\n\n**Indicator 10: Hotel/Motel Backgrounds**\n- Consistent hotel/motel settings\n- Different hotels frequently\n- Pattern of transient locations\n- Combined with location changes\n\n**Indicator 11: Branding/Ownership Tattoos**\n- Tattoos suggesting 'ownership'\n- Names/initials that seem like brands\n- Recent tattoos in prominent locations\n- Coverups of previous brands\n\n**Indicator 12: Substance Abuse Indicators**\n- Visible signs of drug use\n- Impaired appearance in content\n- References to substances for 'coping'\n- Pattern of deterioration\n\n**Indicator 13: Distress Signals**\n- Visible distress in content\n- Crying, fear, or discomfort visible\n- Body language suggesting unwillingness\n- Coded messages or signals\n- Direct requests for help"

If other indicators emerge, escalate.\n\n**Case Study 2: The Managed Account**\nCreator's messages are clearly written by someone else (different tone, refers to performer in third person). Pricing is very low. Content has multiple performers.\n\nINDICATORS: Third-party control, pricing anomalies, multiple performers\nASSESSMENT: MEDIUM to HIGH\nACTION: Flag immediately. Escalate to senior moderator. Enhanced monitoring.\n\n**Case Study 3: Clear Distress**\nIn a video, performer appears to be crying before composing themselves. Messages mention 'having to do this' and 'paying off what I owe.' Recent tattoo visible that appears to be initials.\n\nINDICATORS: Distress signals, coercion language, debt mention, branding\nASSESSMENT: CRITICAL\nACTION: Immediate escalation to Compliance Officer. Account suspension. Evidence preservation. FBI notification likely.\n\n**Case Study 4: The New Creator**\nBrand new account with aggressive pricing. Posts from hotel. Seems nervous in videos.\n\nINDICATORS: Pricing anomaly, hotel background, possible distress\nASSESSMENT: LOW to MEDIUM\nACTION: Monitor closely. Many new creators are nervous and price low. Watch for additional indicators.\n\n**Remember:**\nWhen in doubt, escalate. It's better to over-report than miss actual trafficking."
