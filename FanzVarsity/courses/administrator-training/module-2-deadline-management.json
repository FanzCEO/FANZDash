Missing these deadlines can result in significant penalties and legal liability.\n\n**The Four Critical Deadlines:**\n\n1. **NCMEC Reporting: 24 Hours**\n   - Triggered by: CSAM detection\n   - Clock starts: Detection confirmation\n   - Consequence: Federal crime, $300K/violation\n\n2. **DSA Response: 14 Days**\n   - Triggered by: EU user complaint\n   - Clock starts: Complaint submission\n   - Consequence: Up to 6% global revenue\n\n3. **GDPR Response: 30 Days**\n   - Triggered by: Data subject request\n   - Clock starts: Request verification\n   - Consequence: Up to €20M or 4% revenue\n\n4. **2257 Record Availability: 48 Hours**\n   - Triggered by: FBI inspection request\n   - Clock starts: Notice received\n   - Consequence: 5-10 years imprisonment\n\n**Why Deadline Management Matters:**\n- Legal compliance is non-negotiable\n- Penalties are severe\n- Reputation damage can be worse than fines\n- Creates audit trail for regulators\n- Demonstrates good faith compliance"
