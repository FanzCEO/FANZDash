This is perhaps the most critical module in this course because understanding what content is prohibited can protect you from serious legal consequences and help keep our community safe.\n\nThe Fanz platform, like all legitimate adult content platforms, has strict content policies. These aren't arbitrary rules – they're based on:\n\n1. **Federal and state laws** - Some content is illegal to produce, distribute, or possess\n2. **Payment processor requirements** - Visa, Mastercard, and other processors ban specific content categories\n3. **Community safety** - Protecting users from harmful content\n4. **Ethical standards** - Maintaining a platform that respects human dignity\n\nLet's examine the 9 prohibited content categories in detail."

        "title": "The 9 Prohibited Categories",
        "duration": "8:00",
        "script": "Here are the 9 categories of content that are strictly prohibited on all Fanz platforms:\n\n**Category 1: CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material)**\nThis is content depicting the sexual exploitation of minors. This is a federal crime under 18 U.S.C. § 2252. There is ZERO tolerance. Any detection results in immediate NCMEC reporting, account termination, and law enforcement notification. Penalties include 15-30 years imprisonment. This includes real images, computer-generated images, and text describing abuse.\n\n**Category 2: Content Depicting or Appearing to Depict Minors**\nEven if all performers are 18+, content that appears to depict minors is prohibited. This includes:\n- 'Barely legal' marketing (emphasizing someone just turned 18)\n- School uniforms or settings suggesting underage\n- Performers made to look younger through makeup or clothing\n- Age play or references to being underage\nPayment processors specifically ban this category.\n\n**Category 3: Incest**\nContent depicting or describing sexual activity between family members is prohibited. This includes:\n- Actual incest\n- Roleplay incest (step-family scenarios)\n- Fantasy/fiction involving family relationships\nEven if clearly labeled as fantasy or roleplay, this content is banned by payment processors.\n\n**Category 4: Bestiality**\nSexual content involving animals is illegal in 47 US states and most countries. This includes:\n- Real bestiality\n- Simulated bestiality\n- Sexual contact with animals\nThere are no exceptions.\n\n**Category 5: Non-Consensual Content**\nAll sexual content must depict consensual activity. Prohibited content includes:\n- Actual non-consensual content (rape)\n- 'Consensual non-consent' (CNC) scenarios\n- Revenge porn\n- Hidden camera/voyeur content without consent\n- Deepfakes of non-consenting individuals\nEven roleplay depicting non-consent is prohibited by payment processors.\n\n**Category 6: Necrophilia**\nContent depicting or simulating sexual activity with deceased individuals is prohibited in all jurisdictions and banned by all payment processors.\n\n**Category 7: Bodily Waste**\nContent involving excrement, urine (in sexual contexts), or vomit is prohibited by payment processors. This is a payment processor requirement, not necessarily a legal one, but platforms must comply to maintain payment processing.\n\n**Category 8: Extreme Violence and Gore**\nWhile some BDSM content is permitted with proper consent documentation, the following is prohibited:\n- Content causing permanent physical harm\n- Blood play\n- Weapons used in sexual contexts\n- Strangulation beyond light breath play\n- Any content that could cause lasting physical damage\n\n**Category 9: Human Trafficking**\nContent that facilitates or depicts human trafficking is prohibited under FOSTA-SESTA. We actively monitor for 13 trafficking indicators including third-party control, coercion language, and distress signals."

        "duration": "2:00",
        "script": "Here's how to ensure your content stays within guidelines:\n\n**DO:**\n- Verify all performers are 18+ with valid ID\n- Keep clear records of consent (model releases)\n- Use accurate, professional descriptions\n- Report any concerning content you encounter\n- Review our prohibited content guidelines before posting\n\n**DON'T:**\n- Use terms like 'teen,' 'young,' or 'barely legal'\n- Create content in school settings or with uniforms\n- Reference family relationships in sexual content\n- Upload content involving violence or weapons\n- Create deepfakes without consent\n- Use coercive or manipulative language\n\n**Gray Areas to Avoid:**\n- Age ambiguity (even if legal, avoid if could be questioned)\n- Power dynamic content that could suggest coercion\n- Any content where consent is unclear\n\nWhen in doubt, don't post it. Contact our compliance team for guidance.\n\nRemember: You are personally responsible for every piece of content you upload. Ignorance of the rules is not a defense. Understanding and following these guidelines protects you, your audience, and the entire Fanz community."
