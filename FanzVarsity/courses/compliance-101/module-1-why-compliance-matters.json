This isn't just about following rules – it's about protecting yourself, protecting others, and ensuring our community thrives.\n\nIn the adult content industry, compliance isn't optional. It's the difference between a platform that operates safely and legally, and one that faces shutdown, criminal charges, and financial ruin. Let's explore why this matters to you."

        "script": "Adult content platforms operate under a complex web of laws across multiple jurisdictions. Let's break down the major ones:\n\n**UK Online Safety Act 2023**: This groundbreaking law requires age verification for all adult content platforms. The penalty? Up to £18 million or 10% of global revenue – whichever is higher.\n\n**US State Laws**: Eight US states now require age verification: Louisiana, Utah, Arkansas, Virginia, Mississippi, Texas, Montana, and North Carolina. More states are following.\n\n**EU GDPR**: The General Data Protection Regulation gives European users strict data privacy rights. Fines can reach €20 million or 4% of global revenue.\n\n**EU Digital Services Act (DSA)**: Requires transparent content moderation and 14-day response times for complaints.\n\n**Federal US Laws**: These are the most serious:\n- 18 U.S.C. § 2258A: Mandatory CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) reporting to NCMEC. Failure is a federal crime.\n- 18 U.S.C. § 2257: Record-keeping requirements for all adult content. Penalties include 5-10 years imprisonment.\n- FOSTA-SESTA: Platforms can be held liable for facilitating trafficking."

        "script": "This isn't theoretical. Major platforms have faced devastating consequences:\n\n**Pornhub (2020)**: After a New York Times exposé, Visa and Mastercard suspended payment processing. The platform removed over 10 million unverified videos overnight.\n\n**Backpage (2018)**: Executives faced federal charges for facilitating trafficking. The platform was seized by the FBI.\n\n**OnlyFans (2021)**: Announced plans to ban explicit content due to payment processor pressure. They reversed course, but the threat was real.\n\nThese examples show that non-compliance can destroy a platform – and the careers of everyone on it."

        "title": "How Compliance Protects You",
        "duration": "2:00",
        "script": "Compliance isn't just about avoiding penalties. It creates a safer ecosystem for everyone:\n\n**For Users**: Age verification keeps minors away from adult content. Content moderation removes illegal and harmful material. GDPR ensures your personal data is protected.\n\n**For Creators**: Compliance means your content is protected from piracy. Your earnings are safe because payment processors trust the platform. You're protected from being associated with illegal content.\n\n**For the Platform**: Compliance enables partnerships with payment processors, advertisers, and other platforms. It builds trust with users and regulators.\n\nWhen everyone follows the rules, we all benefit. That's why your participation in compliance isn't just required – it's appreciated."
