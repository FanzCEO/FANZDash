        "script": "Welcome to Module 2: Age Verification Basics. This module will walk you through everything you need to know about age verification on the Fanz platform.\n\nLet's start with why age verification exists. It's simple: adult content is for adults only. Laws around the world require platforms to verify that users are 18 or older before accessing sexually explicit content.\n\n**Legal Requirements by Jurisdiction:**\n\n**United Kingdom**: The Online Safety Act 2023 requires 'highly effective' age verification for all pornographic content. Failure to comply can result in fines up to £18 million or blocking of the platform in the UK.\n\n**United States**: Eight states now require age verification: Louisiana, Utah, Arkansas, Virginia, Mississippi, Texas, Montana, and North Carolina. These laws require government ID verification or age-assurance technology.\n\n**European Union**: While the DSA doesn't mandate specific age verification, platforms must protect minors. The upcoming AI Act and member state laws are increasing requirements.\n\n**Australia**: The proposed Online Safety (Basic Online Safety Expectations) rules are moving toward mandatory verification.\n\nAge verification isn't optional – it's the law. And on Fanz, we use VerifyMy to ensure compliance while protecting your privacy."

        "title": "The 4 Verification Methods",
        "duration": "6:00",
        "script": "Fanz offers four methods to verify your age. Let's walk through each one:\n\n**Method 1: VerifyMy (Recommended)**\nVerifyMy is our recommended verification partner. Here's how it works:\n- You scan your government ID using your phone camera\n- VerifyMy verifies the ID is real and matches your face\n- Fanz receives a 'verified 18+' confirmation – NOT your actual ID documents\n- The process takes 2-5 minutes\n- One verification works across all Fanz ecosystem platforms\n\nThis is the most privacy-preserving option because Fanz never sees your ID directly.\n\n**Method 2: ID Document Upload**\nIf VerifyMy isn't available in your region:\n- Upload a clear photo of your government ID\n- Our team manually verifies your age\n- ID is securely stored per 2257 requirements (7 years)\n- Processing takes 24-48 hours\n\n**Method 3: Credit Card Verification**\nFor users 18+ with a valid credit card:\n- Enter your credit card details\n- A small authorization is made and immediately reversed\n- Credit cards in most jurisdictions are only issued to 18+\n- Instant verification\n- Note: This is not accepted in jurisdictions requiring document-based verification\n\n**Method 4: AI Age Estimation**\nFor quick access before full verification:\n- Take a selfie\n- AI estimates your age from facial features\n- Provides temporary 24-hour access if estimated 25+\n- Must complete full verification within 24 hours\n- Not accepted in UK or states requiring document verification"

Here's exactly what happens to your data:\n\n**With VerifyMy:**\n- Your ID is processed by VerifyMy, not Fanz\n- Fanz only receives: verification status (yes/no), age bracket (18+), and verification ID\n- Your actual ID documents are NOT stored by Fanz\n- VerifyMy's retention policy complies with GDPR and can be deleted on request\n\n**With ID Upload:**\n- Your ID is stored securely with AES-256 encryption\n- Access is limited to compliance team members\n- Stored for 7 years per 18 U.S.C. § 2257 requirements\n- You can request deletion after the retention period\n\n**What We Store:**\n- Verification status (verified/not verified)\n- Verification date\n- Verification method used\n- Jurisdiction of verification\n\n**What We Don't Store (with VerifyMy):**\n- Your ID document images\n- Your ID number\n- Your exact date of birth\n- Your address\n\nYour privacy is protected by both our policies and laws like GDPR. If you're concerned about privacy, use VerifyMy – it's specifically designed to verify your age without exposing your personal information."

        "duration": "3:00",
        "script": "Let's address some common issues users encounter during verification:\n\n**'My ID was rejected'**\n- Ensure your ID is not expired\n- Take a clear, well-lit photo\n- Make sure all four corners are visible\n- Try a different ID type if available\n\n**'The selfie doesn't match'**\n- Remove glasses, hats, and masks\n- Ensure good lighting on your face\n- Look directly at the camera\n- If you've significantly changed appearance since ID photo, contact support\n\n**'Verification is taking too long'**\n- VerifyMy: Usually instant, max 5 minutes\n- Manual review: 24-48 hours during business hours\n- Contact support if it exceeds these times\n\n**'I'm using VPN and can't verify'**\n- Disable VPN during verification\n- Your real location is needed to apply correct jurisdiction rules\n- After verification, you can use VPN normally\n\n**'I verified on another Fanz platform but need to verify again'**\n- If using FanzSSO, your verification carries across all platforms\n- If you used a different login method, you may need to link accounts\n- Contact support to connect verification to your account\n\nRemember: Verification is required by law. Attempting to bypass it using someone else's ID or false information is fraud and will result in permanent ban and potential legal action."
