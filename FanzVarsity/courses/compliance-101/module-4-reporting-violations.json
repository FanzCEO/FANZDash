        "script": "Welcome to the final module of Compliance 101: Reporting Violations. This module covers one of the most important contributions you can make to platform safety – reporting content that violates our guidelines.\n\nYou might wonder: 'Why is it my responsibility to report?' Here's why:\n\n**Scale**: With millions of pieces of content uploaded, our automated systems and moderation team can't catch everything. User reports are a critical safety layer.\n\n**Context**: You understand nuances that AI might miss. A performer's distress signals, context that indicates coercion, or subtle violations that slip past automated detection.\n\n**Community**: When you report violations, you protect other users, creators, and the entire platform. Non-compliance by anyone threatens everyone.\n\n**Legal obligation**: For certain content – particularly CSAM – there may be legal obligations to report. Knowingly failing to report certain illegal content could have legal consequences.\n\nReporting isn't about policing other users – it's about keeping our community safe and legal. Every legitimate platform depends on community participation in safety."

Don't investigate or gather more evidence – that's the moderation team's job."

Decision is made: remove content, warn creator, or find no violation\n\n**Actions Taken:**\n- **No violation found**: Content remains, you're notified\n- **Minor violation**: Content removed, creator warned\n- **Serious violation**: Content removed, account suspended\n- **Criminal content**: Content removed, law enforcement notified\n\n**You'll Be Notified:**\nYou'll receive a notification about the outcome of your report. Note that for privacy reasons, we can't always share specific actions taken against another user.\n\n**Response Times:**\n- Standard reports: 24-48 hours\n- Priority reports (CSAM, trafficking): 1-4 hours\n- EU DSA complaints: 14 days maximum (legal requirement)"
