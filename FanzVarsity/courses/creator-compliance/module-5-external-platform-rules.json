        "script": "Welcome to Module 5. Many Fanz creators cross-post content to external platforms like OnlyFans, Fansly, and ManyVids. This module covers compliance requirements when uploading outside the Fanz ecosystem.\n\n**Fanz MediaHub Integration:**\n\nFanz MediaHub allows you to manage and distribute content across multiple platforms from one dashboard. When you use MediaHub to post to external platforms, we add a compliance layer.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nExternal platforms have their OWN policies, which may be similar to or different from Fanz. Content that's allowed on one platform may be prohibited on another. Using MediaHub helps ensure your content is checked against each platform's policies before upload.\n\n**Compliance Screening Before External Upload:**\n\nWhen you use MediaHub to post to external platforms, your content is screened for:\n\n1. **CSAM Detection** - PhotoDNA hash matching against known CSAM databases\n2. **Payment Processor Compliance** - Checking against the 9 prohibited categories\n3. **Trafficking Assessment** - Analyzing for trafficking indicators\n4. **Platform-Specific Rules** - Checking against destination platform policies\n\nIf any check fails, the upload is blocked with an explanation of why."

Here's what you need to know:\n\n**OnlyFans (Strictest)**\n\nOnlyFans has some of the strictest policies in the industry due to past payment processor issues:\n\n- All 9 prohibited categories apply strictly\n- No incest themes including step-family\n- No blood, violence, or extreme BDSM\n- No 'barely legal' marketing\n- Strict verification requirements\n- Content metadata scanned\n- High risk of account termination for violations\n\n**Fansly (Similar to OnlyFans)**\n\nFansly follows similar policies:\n\n- Same 9 prohibited categories\n- Slightly more lenient on BDSM (but still limits)\n- Step-family content prohibited\n- Age-related marketing prohibited\n- Active content moderation\n\n**ManyVids (More Permissive)**\n\nManyVids has historically been more permissive:\n\n- Core prohibited categories apply\n- Some niche content allowed that isn't elsewhere\n- Still subject to payment processor requirements\n- Review policies before assuming content is allowed\n\n**Pornhub/MindGeek (Strict Post-2020)**\n\nAfter the 2020 crisis:\n\n- Only verified uploaders\n- All content human-reviewed\n- Strict prohibited content enforcement\n- Rapid takedown of flagged content\n\n**Patreon (No Explicit Content)**\n\nPatreon does NOT allow sexually explicit content:\n\n- Nudity allowed in artistic context\n- No pornographic content\n- No sexual acts\n- Do NOT upload explicit content to Patreon\n\n**Key Differences:**\n- Each platform interprets policies differently\n- What's allowed on Fansly might fail on OnlyFans\n- Always check destination platform policies\n- MediaHub flags platform-specific issues"

Here's how to handle it:\n\n**Understanding Failure Messages:**\n\n'CSAM_DETECTED' - Content matched known CSAM hash\n- Immediate account flag\n- Cannot proceed\n- NCMEC report filed\n- Contact compliance team\n\n'PAYMENT_PROCESSOR_VIOLATION' - Failed 9-category check\n- Specific category identified\n- Content cannot be posted as-is\n- Modification required\n- May need different platforms\n\n'RISK_SCORE_EXCEEDED' - Risk score too high\n- Score and contributing factors shown\n- May need title/description changes\n- May need content edits\n- Can request manual review\n\n'PLATFORM_POLICY_VIOLATION' - Fails destination platform rules\n- Specific platform and issue identified\n- May work on different platform\n- Check alternative platforms\n\n**Resolving Issues:**\n\n1. **Read the error message carefully** - It tells you what's wrong\n2. **Make targeted changes** - Don't guess, address the specific issue\n3. **Re-screen** - Run through screening again\n4. **Consider alternatives** - Different platform, different content format\n5. **Contact support** - If you believe it's an error\n\n**Keywords That Often Cause Issues:**\n\nThe following keywords frequently trigger failures:\n- 'Teen,' 'young,' 'barely legal,' 'innocent'\n- 'Step-mom,' 'step-sis,' or any family terms\n- 'Force,' 'rape,' 'unwilling,' 'drunk'\n- 'School,' 'dorm,' 'cheerleader'\n- 'Blood,' 'torture,' 'extreme'\n\n**Alternative Terms:**\n- 'Amateur,' 'new,' 'petite' instead of age-related\n- 'Couple,' 'partner' instead of relationship terms\n- 'Roleplay,' 'scene' for fantasy content\n- 'Office,' 'home' instead of school settings"
