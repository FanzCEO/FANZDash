        "script": "In Compliance 101, you learned the basics of prohibited content. As a creator, you need deeper understanding because your livelihood depends on compliance.\n\n**What's at Stake:**\n- Your income (payment processing can be cut)\n- Your reputation (violations are documented)\n- Your freedom (some violations are crimes)\n- Other creators (platform violations affect everyone)\n\n**Why Creators Get It Wrong:**\n- Assuming 'it's just fantasy' makes content OK\n- Not understanding payment processor requirements\n- Copying trends without checking compliance\n- Pushing boundaries without knowing the lines\n\nThis module goes deep into each category so you understand exactly what's prohibited and why. We'll cover edge cases that trip up experienced creators."

        "script": "**Category 1: Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)**\n\nThis is the most serious category. There are NO exceptions, NO gray areas, NO second chances.\n\n**What Qualifies as CSAM:**\n- Any visual depiction of a minor engaged in sexually explicit conduct\n- Real images, CGI/AI-generated images, or drawings\n- Text describing sexual abuse of minors (in some jurisdictions)\n- Audio content describing such abuse\n\n**Automatic Consequences:**\n- Content immediately blocked\n- Account permanently terminated\n- Mandatory NCMEC CyberTipline report (within 24 hours)\n- FBI notification\n- Evidence preserved for prosecution\n- No appeal possible\n\n**Your Responsibilities:**\n- VERIFY every performer's age before filming\n- Do not work with anyone who appears underage regardless of ID\n- Report any CSAM you encounter immediately\n- Do NOT download, save, or share suspected CSAM\n\n**Federal Penalties:**\n- Production: 15-30 years imprisonment\n- Distribution: 5-20 years imprisonment\n- Possession: Up to 20 years imprisonment\n- Sex offender registration for life\n\nThis is not an area where you can make mistakes. If there's any doubt about someone's age, do not proceed."

        "script": "**Category 2: Content Appearing to Depict Minors**\n\nThis is where many creators get tripped up. Even if all performers are verified 18+, content can be prohibited if it APPEARS to depict minors.\n\n**Prohibited Elements:**\n- 'Barely legal' or 'just turned 18' marketing\n- References to high school, prom, or graduation\n- School uniforms, cheerleader outfits in sexual contexts\n- Pigtails, braces, or styling to appear younger\n- Bedroom sets that look like a child's room\n- Terms like 'teen,' 'young,' 'fresh,' 'innocent' in sexual context\n- Age play or pretending to be underage\n- Babysitter, tutoring, or other scenarios suggesting minors\n\n**Payment Processor Position:**\nVisa and Mastercard specifically ban content that 'appears to depict minors' regardless of actual ages. If they determine your content falls in this category, they can:\n- Cut off your payment processing\n- Require content removal across all platforms\n- Ban you from their networks\n\n**Risk Score Impact:**\nContent with these elements receives high risk scores (40-80+):\n- 'Teen' in title: +30 risk points\n- School settings: +50 risk points\n- Age-ambiguous appearance: +25 risk points\n- 'Barely legal' marketing: +60 risk points\n\n**Safe Alternatives:**\n- Instead of 'teen': 'amateur,' 'new creator,' 'petite'\n- Instead of school: office, gym, other adult settings\n- Avoid emphasizing youth or inexperience in sexual context\n- Market maturity and confidence instead"

There are no exceptions for roleplay, fantasy, or fiction.\n\n**What's Prohibited:**\n- Actual incest (obviously illegal)\n- Step-family scenarios (step-mom, step-sister, etc.)\n- Adoption-related scenarios\n- Any family relationship in sexual context\n- 'Taboo' content using family terms\n- Even implied family relationships\n\n**Why Step-Family Content is Banned:**\nPayment processors made this decision after determining:\n- It normalizes incest\n- It can't be distinguished from actual incest\n- It's one of the most-requested removal categories\n- Reputational risk is too high\n\n**Common Creator Mistakes:**\n- 'But it's just step- not real family' - Still prohibited\n- 'We never say the word, we just imply it' - Still prohibited\n- 'Lots of other sites have it' - Those sites risk payment processing\n- 'It's just roleplay' - Roleplay doesn't exempt prohibited content\n\n**Risk Score:**\nFamily-related terms in titles, descriptions, or tags result in:\n- Immediate risk score 80+ (blocked)\n- Flagging of all account content\n- Required review of existing catalog\n\n**If You Have This Content:**\n- Remove it immediately\n- Re-edit to remove family references\n- Update titles, descriptions, and tags\n- Do not re-upload with slight changes"

Prohibited content includes:\n\n- Actual non-consensual acts (rape)\n- CNC (consensual non-consent) roleplay\n- 'Rape fantasy' scenarios\n- Drugging scenarios\n- Unconscious/sleeping person scenarios\n- Forced/coerced scenarios\n- Hidden camera/voyeur without actual consent\n- Deepfakes of non-consenting individuals\n- Revenge porn\n\n**Payment Processor Position:**\nEven with documented consent between performers, CNC content is prohibited. Visa/Mastercard cannot distinguish real from fake non-consent, so they ban all of it.\n\n**Safe BDSM Alternative:**\nBDSM with clear consent demonstration is allowed:\n- Visible negotiation\n- Safe words established\n- Enthusiastic verbal consent\n- Aftercare shown\n- 'Check-in' moments visible\n\n**Category 6: Necrophilia**\nSexual content involving deceased individuals is:\n- Illegal everywhere\n- Banned by all processors\n- Zero tolerance on all platforms\n\nThis includes actual and simulated necrophilia.

If you create this content, you need alternative payment processors.\n\n**Category 8: Extreme Violence**\nBDSM has limits. Prohibited content includes:\n\n- Blood drawing or blood play\n- Broken bones or permanent injury\n- Strangulation beyond light breath play\n- Weapons in sexual contact\n- Punching, kicking, or striking face/head\n- Burns or branding\n- Anything causing lasting physical damage\n\n**Allowed BDSM:**\n- Spanking, flogging with appropriate implements\n- Bondage with safety demonstrated\n- Dominance/submission roleplay\n- Sensation play\n- Most kink that doesn't cause injury\n\n**Gray Area:** Impact play - if it leaves marks, document consent carefully. If it draws blood, it's prohibited.\n\n**Category 9: Human Trafficking**\nUnder FOSTA-SESTA, content facilitating trafficking is prohibited:\n\n**13 Trafficking Indicators We Monitor:**\n1. Third-party management or control language\n2. Rapid location changes (multiple cities)\n3. Multiple performers on single account\n4. Suspiciously low pricing\n5. Coercion language ('have to,' 'forced')\n6. Age ambiguity or school references\n7. Restricted communication\n8. Unusual ID document requests\n9. Cash-only payment insistence\n10. Hotel/motel backgrounds consistently\n11. Branding/ownership tattoos\n12. Substance abuse indicators\n13.
