Here's what's required:\n\n**Creator Self-Verification:**\n\nBefore you can monetize any content, you must complete:\n\n1. **Age Verification via VerifyMy**\n   - Same process as user verification\n   - Scan government ID\n   - Facial match confirmation\n   - Instant verification\n\n2. **Enhanced Creator Verification**\n   - Selfie holding ID and today's date (written on paper)\n   - Video verification may be required\n   - Platform may request video call for high-risk situations\n\n3. **Identity Confirmation**\n   - Name matches payment account\n   - Tax information matches ID\n   - Address verification may be required\n\n**What Happens After Creator Verification:**\n- Your verification is linked to your creator profile\n- You can upload content\n- Monetization features enabled\n- 2257 compliance activated\n- Your records are maintained per federal requirements\n\n**Re-verification:**\n- If your ID expires, you'll need to re-verify\n- If you change legal name, update verification\n- Periodic spot-checks may occur\n- Always keep ID information current"

This is one of the most important parts of 2257 compliance.\n\n**Before EVERY Collaboration:**\n\n**Step 1: Request ID in Advance**\n- Ask for photo of their ID before meeting\n- Verify it's not obviously fake\n- Check that it's not expired\n- This is a pre-screening, not final verification\n\n**Step 2: Verify in Person**\n- When you meet, verify ID again IN PERSON\n- The person in front of you must match the ID\n- Check ID for tampering (photo swaps, date alterations)\n- If anything seems off, DO NOT PROCEED\n\n**Step 3: Document Everything**\n- Take clear copy of front (and back if applicable) of ID\n- Complete model release form\n- Have them sign age declaration\n- Keep all documents organized\n\n**Step 4: Create 2257 Record**\n- Record their legal name (from ID)\n- Record date of birth (from ID)\n- Document all stage names they'll use\n- Note production date and location\n- Keep ID copy with records\n\n**Verification Timeline:**\n- BEFORE any filming occurs\n- Not during - BEFORE\n- Not after - BEFORE\n- If someone won't verify before filming, don't film them\n\n**What to Look For:**\n- ID appears genuine (not printed at home)\n- Photo matches person in front of you\n- Date of birth makes them 18+ on production date\n- ID is not expired\n- No visible alterations or tampering"

Do NOT proceed with filming\n2. Make an excuse to end the meeting\n3. Document what you observed\n4. Report to platform if you have concerns\n5. Consider contacting National Human Trafficking Hotline if trafficking suspected\n\n**Trust Your Instincts:**\nIf something feels wrong, it probably is. No content is worth potential involvement with a minor or trafficking victim."

        "duration": "4:00",
        "script": "Let's address one of the most common compliance failures: 'barely legal' content and marketing.\n\n**Why 'Barely Legal' is Prohibited:**\n\nPayment processors specifically ban content that emphasizes performers have recently turned 18. The reasoning:\n\n1. **It sexualizes youth** - The appeal is explicitly that they're as close to minor as legally possible\n2. **It's adjacent to CSAM interest** - Those seeking this content may be seeking minors\n3. **Brand risk** - No legitimate payment processor wants association\n4. **Legal gray area** - Creates questions about when content was actually produced\n\n**Prohibited Terms and Phrases:**\n- 'Barely legal'\n- 'Just turned 18'\n- 'Legal teen'\n- 'Fresh 18'\n- 'Teen' in sexual context\n- '18-year-old' as a marketing point\n- 'First time on their 18th birthday'\n- 'Finally legal'\n- Any emphasis on recent 18th birthday\n\n**Age Play is Also Prohibited:**\n- Pretending to be underage\n- 'Daddy's little girl' type scenarios\n- Baby talk or infantilization in sexual context\n- Diapers, bottles, or baby items in sexual content\n- School uniforms, braces, or teen styling\n\n**What Happens If You Use These:**\n- Immediate high risk score (60-80+)\n- Content blocked or removed\n- Strike issued\n- Account flagged for full review\n- Possible payment processing issues\n\n**Alternative Marketing:**\n- Focus on what you DO offer, not age\n- 'Amateur' instead of 'teen'\n- 'New to content creation'\n- 'Independent creator'\n- 'Petite' if describing body type\n- Your personality and unique qualities"
