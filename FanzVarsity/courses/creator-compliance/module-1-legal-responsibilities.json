        "script": "Welcome to Creator Compliance. This course is required before you can monetize content on any Fanz platform. Let's start with the most important mindset shift: you're not just a content creator – you're a business owner.\n\n**Your Legal Status:**\nWhen you earn money from adult content, you become a self-employed individual running your own business. This means:\n\n- You're an independent contractor, not an employee of Fanz\n- You file taxes as self-employed (Schedule C)\n- You're personally responsible for compliance with all applicable laws\n- You can be held personally liable for violations\n- Business expenses can be deducted (equipment, costumes, subscriptions)\n\n**What This Means for Liability:**\n\nFanz provides the platform, but you're responsible for:\n- The legality of YOUR content\n- Verifying ages of anyone appearing in YOUR content\n- Maintaining YOUR records per 2257\n- Ensuring YOUR content doesn't violate policies\n\nWhen something goes wrong, you can't say 'Fanz should have stopped me.' You're expected to know and follow the rules. This course teaches you those rules.\n\n**Business Structure Options:**\nMany creators eventually form business entities for protection:\n- Sole Proprietorship (default, no protection)\n- LLC (Limited Liability Company) - Most common for creators\n- S-Corp (for higher earners)\n\nWe recommend consulting with an accountant or attorney as your income grows."

      {
        "title": "Federal Laws That Apply to You",
        "duration": "6:00",
        "script": "As a content creator, several federal laws directly apply to your business:\n\n**18 U.S.C. § 2257 - Record Keeping Requirements**\nThis is the most important law for adult content creators. It requires:\n- Age verification for all performers in sexually explicit content\n- Maintaining records of legal name, date of birth, and ID copies\n- Keeping records for 7 years\n- Making records available to FBI inspectors within 48 hours\n- Displaying a Custodian of Records statement on all content\n\nPenalties: 5-10 years imprisonment for first offense.\n\nWe'll cover 2257 in depth in Module 2.\n\n**18 U.S.C. § 2252/2256 - CSAM Laws**\nProduction, distribution, or possession of CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) is a federal crime.\n- Penalties: 15-30 years imprisonment\n- Lifetime sex offender registration\n- These laws apply even if you unknowingly produce content with a minor\n- This is why age verification is so critical\n\n**FOSTA-SESTA - Trafficking Liability**\nThis 2018 law removed some platform protections and applies to individuals too:\n- You cannot knowingly facilitate sex trafficking\n- Working with a trafficked performer makes you potentially liable\n- You must recognize and refuse to work with suspected trafficking victims\n\n**Copyright Law (DMCA)**\nYou must respect copyright:\n- Don't use copyrighted music without license\n- Don't copy others' content\n- Register your own content for maximum protection"

        "title": "State and International Laws",
        "duration": "4:00",
        "script": "Beyond federal law, state and international laws may apply to you:\n\n**State Age Verification Laws (8+ states):**\nIf you're selling content accessible to users in these states, their laws may apply:\n- Louisiana, Utah, Arkansas, Virginia, Mississippi, Texas, Montana, North Carolina\n- More states are passing similar laws\n- Fanz handles user-side verification, but you must verify your own performers\n\n**State Obscenity Laws:**\nSome states have stricter obscenity standards. 'Community standards' vary. Content legal in California might face prosecution in other states. Be aware of your location and where you distribute.\n\n**UK Online Safety Act:**\nIf you have UK viewers (and you likely do):\n- Age verification is mandatory for your viewers\n- Fanz handles this, but non-compliance affects everyone\n- Penalties up to £18 million\n\n**EU GDPR:**\nIf you have EU customers:\n- You must respect data protection rights\n- Customers can request access to or deletion of their data\n- You must handle personal information responsibly\n- Fanz provides tools to help you comply\n\n**EU Digital Services Act (DSA):**\n- Content moderation transparency requirements\n- 14-day response requirement for complaints\n- Fanz handles platform-level compliance, but you must respond to legitimate requests\n\n**Your Location Matters:**\nKnow the laws in YOUR state/country. If you're creating from a strict jurisdiction, additional requirements may apply."
