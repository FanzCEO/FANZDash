        "duration": "5:00",
        "script": "This module is arguably the most important for content creators. 18 U.S.C. § 2257 is a federal law that requires producers of sexually explicit content to verify and maintain records proving all performers are 18 or older.\n\n**Why This Law Exists:**\nThis law was created to prevent child exploitation in the adult industry. Before 2257, there were cases of minors appearing in adult content because producers didn't verify ages. The law ensures every person in sexually explicit content is legally an adult.\n\n**Who Does 2257 Apply To?**\n- Anyone who produces sexually explicit visual content (photos, videos)\n- This includes solo creators, couples, and studios\n- If you film yourself, you're the producer\n- If you film with others, you're responsible for their records too\n\n**What is 'Sexually Explicit Conduct'?**\nUnder 2257, sexually explicit conduct includes:\n- Actual or simulated intercourse\n- Genital or pubic area displayed for sexual purposes\n- Graphic sexual stimulation\n\nNote: Nudity alone isn't necessarily covered, but to be safe, treat all adult content as covered by 2257.\n\n**The Basic Requirement:**\nFor every person appearing in your sexually explicit content, you must:\n1. Verify they are 18+ by examining valid government ID\n2. Create and maintain records documenting this verification\n3. Keep these records for 7 years\n4. Make records available for FBI inspection\n5. Include a Custodian of Records statement on content"

Government-Issued ID Copy**\nA copy of at least one valid government-issued photo ID:\n- Driver's license\n- Passport\n- State/national ID card\n- Military ID\n\nThe ID must be:\n- Valid (not expired) at time of production\n- Readable photo copy (can be digital)\n- Show name, date of birth, and photo\n\n**4. All Stage Names and Aliases**\nDocument every name the performer uses in content:\n- Stage names\n- Screen names\n- Social media handles used in content\n- Any alias they perform under\n\n**5. URLs/Locations of Content**\nRecord where the content featuring this performer appears:\n- Fanz profile URLs\n- Specific content URLs\n- External platform links\n- Any location where content is distributed\n\n**6. Date of Production**\nThe date when the content was created.\n\n**Record Format:**\nRecords can be maintained:\n- Digitally (encrypted storage recommended)\n- Physically (secure filing cabinet)\n- Hybrid (original IDs verified in person, digital copies kept)\n\nDigital records must be:\n- Organized by performer\n- Searchable\n- Backed up\n- Available for inspection within 20 minutes\n\n**Retention Period:**\nRecords must be kept for 7 years from:\n- Date of last publication of content, OR\n- Date performer's last content was produced\n\nEven if you delete content, keep the records for 7 years from when it was last live."

Request ID before arrival\n2. Verify ID in person (no fakes)\n3. Ensure ID matches the person\n4. Complete model release\n5. Keep copies of everything\n\n**Red Flags to Watch For:**\n- Person looks younger than ID shows\n- ID appears altered or fake\n- Person seems coached or controlled\n- Third party doing all the talking\n- Person can't answer basic questions about themselves\n- Reluctance to sign documents\n\nIf something feels wrong, DO NOT PROCEED. It's not worth the risk.\n\n**Fan Collaboration Content:**\nIf you meet fans for content:\n- SAME rules apply\n- No exceptions because they're 'just a fan'\n- ID verification and model release REQUIRED\n- Their excitement doesn't replace compliance"
