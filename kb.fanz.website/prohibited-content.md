## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: What if content is obviously roleplay/fantasy?
**A:** Payment processors don't distinguish between real and fantasy for prohibited categories. Even consensual roleplay of incest, non-consent, or minors is prohibited.

### Q: Can I use "barely legal" in my title if the performer is 18+?
**A:** No. Payment processors flag "barely legal" and similar terms as high-risk, even if everyone is 18+.

### Q: What about cartoon/anime content?
**A:** Cartoons depicting minors sexually are illegal under PROTECT Act 2003. Adult cartoon content must depict clearly adult characters.

**A:** No. Prohibited content rules apply to everyone equally. No exceptions for:
- Professional producers

### Q: What if I blur/censor prohibited content?
**A:** Blurring or censoring does not make prohibited content compliant. If the underlying content violates policy, it's still prohibited.
