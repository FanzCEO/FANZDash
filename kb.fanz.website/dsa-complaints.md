## Common Reasons for Complaints

### 1. False Positive - Content Doesn't Violate Policy

**Example:**
- Content removed for "incest" language
- You used "daddy" in BDSM context (dominant/submissive), not family roleplay
- AI misinterpreted context

**How to Appeal:**
- Explain context clearly
- Provide evidence (e.g., full caption showing BDSM context, not incest)
- Reference policy (show that BDSM is allowed, but incest is not)

**Likelihood of Success:** High (if you can demonstrate clear non-violation)

---

### 2. Disproportionate Penalty

**Example:**
- First-time minor violation (unclear caption wording)
- Account immediately suspended for 30 days (severe penalty)
- You believe warning would have been sufficient

**How to Appeal:**
- Acknowledge violation (if it did occur)
- Argue penalty is disproportionate to offense
- Emphasize first-time offense, no pattern of violations
- Request reduced penalty (warning instead of suspension)

**Likelihood of Success:** Medium (depends on severity of violation)

---

### 3. Content Was Educational/Artistic (Freedom of Expression)

**Example:**
- Educational content about sexual health removed for "explicit content"
- Artistic nude photography removed for "pornography"
- You argue content has legitimate educational/artistic purpose

**How to Appeal:**
- Emphasize educational/artistic purpose
- Cite freedom of expression (protected under EU law)
- Provide context (e.g., medical education, fine art photography)
- Show content doesn't violate policy when context is considered

**Likelihood of Success:** Medium (depends on clarity of educational/artistic purpose)

---

### 4. User Report Was Malicious (Harassment Campaign)

**Example:**
- Multiple users reported your content
- You believe reports are coordinated harassment (e.g., ex-partner, competitor)
- Content doesn't actually violate policy

**How to Appeal:**
- Explain harassment campaign
- Provide evidence (e.g., messages showing coordination, pattern of false reports)
- Show content is policy-compliant
- Request investigation of malicious reporters

**Likelihood of Success:** Medium-High (if evidence of coordinated harassment is strong)

---

### 5. Mistaken Identity (Content Not Yours)

**Example:**
- Content removed from your account
- You didn't upload this content (account compromised, or platform error)

**How to Appeal:**
- Explain you didn't upload content
- Provide evidence (e.g., you were offline when content was uploaded)
- Request security review (account may have been compromised)

**Likelihood of Success:** High (if evidence is clear)

---

## Out-of-Court Dispute Resolution

### When to Escalate

**Escalate if:**
- ✅ Internal complaint was denied
- ✅ You still believe decision was incorrect
- ✅ Dispute is within 6 months of original decision

**Do NOT escalate if:**
- ❌ Internal complaint was upheld (you already won)
- ❌ More than 6 months have passed
- ❌ Decision was based on legal obligation (court order, etc.)

## FAQ for EU Users

### Do I have to wait 14 days for my complaint to be reviewed?

**Maximum 14 days.** Many complaints are resolved faster (often 3-7 days). You'll receive confirmation within 24 hours with estimated review completion date.

---

### Can I file multiple complaints for different content removals?

**Yes.** Each piece of content can have separate complaint. However, if you file excessive complaints (e.g., 10+ per month), we may ask you to consolidate or prioritize.

---

### What if my complaint is denied? Can I appeal again?

**No second internal complaint.** If your internal complaint is denied, your next step is out-of-court dispute resolution (see above). You cannot re-file the same complaint internally.

---

### Is out-of-court dispute resolution really free?

**Mostly low-cost (€50-€150), not completely free.** However, some dispute resolution bodies offer fee waivers for low-income individuals. Check the body's website for eligibility.

---

### What if Fanz Dash doesn't comply with the dispute resolution decision?

**Fanz Dash is legally required to comply (DSA Article 21).** If we don't comply within 14 days:
1. Contact the dispute resolution body (they'll follow up with us)
2. File complaint with your national Digital Services Coordinator (DSC) or EU Commission
3. EU authorities can fine us for non-compliance

---

### Can I file a DSA complaint if I'm from the UK (post-Brexit)?

**No.** DSA applies only to EU/EEA users. However, UK has similar regulations under UK Online Safety Act. Contact legal@fanz.com for UK-specific appeal process.

---

### Can I sue Fanz Dash instead of using DSA complaints?

**Yes.** DSA complaints are optional but recommended (faster, cheaper). You can file lawsuit in your country's courts. However, courts may require you to exhaust internal complaint process first.
