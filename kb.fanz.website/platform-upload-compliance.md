## Overview

Fanz Dash offers automated content upload to external platforms (OnlyFans, Fansly, Patreon, etc.). Before content is uploaded to external platforms, it **must pass comprehensive compliance screening** including CSAM detection, payment processor checks, and trafficking assessments.

This guide explains how external platform compliance works, platform-specific requirements, and best practices for successful uploads.

---

## Why Platform Upload Compliance Matters

### Your Reputation is at Stake

**Getting banned from external platforms can destroy your creator career:**

1. **Permanent Bans**
   - Most platforms permanently ban for serious violations
   - Ban includes payment processing blacklist
   - Cannot create new account (tracked by ID, payment, device)

2. **Payment Processor Termination**
   - Visa/Mastercard violations follow you across all platforms
   - If OnlyFans bans you for payment processor violation, other platforms will too
   - Payment processing blacklists are shared industry-wide

3. **Financial Loss**
   - Lose all subscribers on banned platform
   - Outstanding payments may be forfeited
   - Rebuilding audience on new platform takes months/years

4. **Legal Consequences**
   - Serious violations (CSAM, trafficking) result in criminal charges
   - Federal law enforcement can prosecute across all platforms
   - Fines and imprisonment possible

**Fanz Dash's compliance screening protects you from accidental violations.**

## Stage 1: Fanz Dash Compliance Screening

**All content is screened against Fanz Dash's compliance systems before external upload.**

### CSAM Detection

**Technology:**
- PhotoDNA hash matching
- PDQ hash matching
- AI age estimation + sexual content detection

**What's Checked:**
- Every image and video frame scanned for CSAM
- Compared against NCMEC database
- If match detected: Content blocked, cannot upload anywhere
- Report to NCMEC, account suspended

**Creator Impact:**
- Upload rejected immediately
- Account permanently banned if CSAM detected
- Cannot upload to any external platform

**Related:** [CSAM Detection Guide](./csam-detection-guide.md)

---

### Payment Processor Compliance

**9 Prohibited Content Categories:**

1. **Bestiality** - Sexual content involving animals
2. **Incest** - Blood relatives in sexual situations (including roleplay)
3. **Minors in Sexual Situations** - Anyone appearing under 18
4. **Non-Consensual Content** - Rape, drugging, coercion scenarios
5. **Necrophilia** - Sexual content involving death
6. **Excrement/Bodily Waste** - Scat, vomit, extreme bodily functions
7. **Extreme Violence** - Gore, torture, death mixed with sexual content
8. **Trafficking Indicators** - Content suggesting human trafficking
9. **Age Play Appearing Minor** - Adults roleplaying as children in sexual contexts

**Risk Scoring:**
- AI analyzes content for prohibited categories
- Risk score: 0-100
  - 0-39: Low risk (allowed)
  - 40-79: Medium risk (manual review)
  - 80-100: High risk (blocked from all platforms)

**Why This Matters:**
- Payment processor violations get you banned from Visa/Mastercard
- This ban follows you across ALL adult platforms
- OnlyFans, Fansly, Patreon all use same payment processors
- Getting blacklisted = career over

**Related:** [Prohibited Content List](./prohibited-content.md)

---

### Trafficking Assessment

**13 Indicators Checked:**

1. Third-party management mentions
2. Location changes (multiple cities rapidly)
3. Multiple performers in single account
4. Pricing anomalies (suspiciously low)
5. Coercion language ("forced", "need money")
6. Age ambiguity (looking young, mentioning school)
7. Restricted communication patterns
8. Identification document requests
9. Cash-only payment mentions
10. Hotel/motel backgrounds
11. Branding/tattoos (ownership marks)
12. Substance abuse indicators
13. Distress signals in content

**Risk Levels:**
- Low: 0-2 indicators
- Medium: 3-5 indicators
- High: 6-8 indicators (manual review)
- Critical: 9+ indicators (blocked, investigated)

**Creator Impact:**
- High-risk content held for 24-48 hours for review
- May be asked to provide additional verification
- Confirmed trafficking indicators = account suspension + report to FBI

---

### Age Verification

**All performers in content must be verified 18+:**

**For Solo Content:**
- Your age verification already on file (required to create account)
- No additional steps needed

**For Collaborative Content (Multiple Performers):**
- **Every person appearing in content must be verified**
- Add performers via Fanz Dash dashboard
- Each performer must submit ID verification
- Cannot upload collaborative content until all performers verified

**2257 Compliance:**
- Records kept for 7 years (federal law)
- Available to FBI upon request
- Cannot be deleted even if performer requests

**Related:** [2257 Compliance Guide](./2257-compliance.md)

**Risk Level:** High (strict enforcement)
**Payment Processors:** Visa, Mastercard, Discover, Union Pay

**Additional Prohibited Content (Beyond Payment Processor Rules):**

1. **Weapons**
   - Firearms, knives, replicas

   - Intoxication (appearing drunk or high)
   - Exception: Prescription medication in original container (not focus of content)

3. **Hypnosis/Intoxication**

6. **Incest/Pseudo-Incest**
   - Terms: "daddy/daughter", "mommy/son", "brother/sister", "family"
   - Context: Roleplay scenarios implying family relationships
   - **This is OnlyFans' strictest policy** - AI flags these terms aggressively

7. **Extreme Age Play**
   - "18+", "barely legal", "teen" in title/description
   - School uniforms in sexual contexts
   - Stuffed animals, pacifiers, children's toys in sexual content
   - "Young" or "little" in sexual contexts

**OnlyFans AI Detection:**
- OnlyFans has aggressive AI content scanning
- Scans uploaded content + captions/descriptions
- Keywords in captions can trigger violations even if video is compliant
- Common false positive: "daddy" (even non-incest context)

**Fanz Dash OnlyFans Pre-Screening:**
- Scans captions/descriptions for flagged keywords
- Warns creator before upload
- Suggests alternative wording
- Blocks upload if high probability of OnlyFans violation

**OnlyFans Violation Consequences:**
- **First violation:** Warning (content removed)
- **Second violation:** 7-day account restriction
- **Third violation:** 30-day account restriction
- **Fourth violation:** Permanent ban + payment processing blacklist

---

### Fansly-Specific Compliance

**Platform:** Fansly
**Risk Level:** Medium (moderately strict)
**Payment Processors:** Visa, Mastercard, Paxum, Cryptocurrency

**Differences from OnlyFans:**

**More Lenient:**
- Drugs/intoxication (cannabis allowed in legal jurisdictions)
- Bodily fluids (urination/"watersports" allowed with warning labels)
- Weapons (decorative/background weapons allowed if not threatening)

**Still Prohibited:**
- CSAM, bestiality, non-consent (same as all platforms)
- Incest (real or roleplay)
- Extreme violence
- Trafficking indicators

**Fansly Content Labels:**
- Fansly requires content warnings for certain categories
- Fanz Dash automatically applies appropriate labels:
  - "Extreme Content" - BDSM, bodily fluids
  - "Drug Use" - Cannabis visible
  - "Weapon Visible" - Weapons in frame

**Fansly Violation Consequences:**
- More forgiving than OnlyFans
- Typically 2-3 warnings before account restriction
- Permanent bans rare (reserved for severe violations)

---

### Patreon-Specific Compliance

**Platform:** Patreon
**Risk Level:** Low (focused on financial, not content compliance)
**Payment Processors:** Visa, Mastercard, PayPal, Stripe

**Important Distinction:**
- Patreon is NOT primarily an adult platform
- Adult content allowed but de-emphasized
- More concerned with financial violations (chargebacks, fraud)

**Additional Restrictions:**

1. **Public vs. Patron-Only Content**
   - Adult content MUST be patron-only (behind paywall)
   - Public posts cannot contain explicit sexual content
   - Fanz Dash automatically sets adult content as patron-only

2. **PayPal Compliance**
   - If you accept PayPal, additional restrictions apply
   - PayPal prohibits explicit adult content
   - Recommendation: Disable PayPal, use card payments only

3. **Age Gating**
   - All adult content must have 18+ age gate
   - Fanz Dash automatically applies age restriction flag

**Patreon Violations:**
- Typically result in content removal, not account ban
- Account bans rare unless financial fraud or CSAM

---

### ManyVids, Clips4Sale, Others

**ManyVids:**
- Most permissive platform
- Allows most fetish content (watersports, roleplay, etc.)
- Still prohibits: CSAM, bestiality, real incest, non-consent
- Violation consequences: Content removal, rarely account bans

**Clips4Sale:**
- Fetish-friendly platform
- Wide range of content allowed
- Strong on 2257 compliance (strict ID verification)
- Still prohibits: Standard illegal content (CSAM, etc.)

**LoyalFans, AVN Stars, JustForFans:**
- Similar policies to OnlyFans
- Slightly more lenient on borderline content
- Lower risk of aggressive AI flagging

**Platform Selection Recommendation:**
- **Vanilla content (solo, no extreme fetishes):** OnlyFans (largest audience)
- **Fetish content (BDSM, watersports, roleplay):** Fansly, ManyVids
- **Non-adult + adult hybrid:** Patreon
- **Extreme fetish:** Clips4Sale, ManyVids

---

## Stage 3: Risk Assessment & Upload Decision

### Per-Platform Risk Scoring

**Fanz Dash calculates separate risk scores for each platform:**

**Risk Factors:**

1. **Content Analysis** (50% of score)
   - Prohibited categories for specific platform
   - Keyword detection in captions/descriptions
   - Visual content analysis (AI)

2. **Historical Performance** (25% of score)
   - Previous violations on that platform
   - False positives (content approved by platform after manual review)
   - Removal rate (what % of uploads get removed by platform)

3. **Platform Strictness** (15% of score)
   - OnlyFans: Higher base risk (strict enforcement)
   - Fansly: Medium base risk
   - ManyVids: Lower base risk (permissive)

4. **Account Standing** (10% of score)
   - Current warnings/restrictions on platform
   - Account age (new accounts higher risk)
   - Subscriber count (high-performing accounts get some leniency)

**Risk Score Calculation Example:**

```
Content: BDSM video with bondage, spanking, "daddy" in caption

OnlyFans Risk Score:
  Content: 65 (BDSM okay, but "daddy" triggers incest flag)
  Historical: 20 (2 prior warnings)
  Platform: 30 (OnlyFans strict)
  Account: 10 (account in good standing)
  TOTAL: 65 × 0.5 + 20 × 0.25 + 30 × 0.15 + 10 × 0.1 = 41.5 (MEDIUM RISK)

Fansly Risk Score:
  Content: 25 (BDSM and "daddy" both allowed)
  Historical: 5 (no prior violations)
  Platform: 15 (Fansly moderately strict)
  Account: 10 (account in good standing)
  TOTAL: 25 × 0.5 + 5 × 0.25 + 15 × 0.15 + 10 × 0.1 = 16 (LOW RISK)

ManyVids Risk Score:
  Content: 10 (all content allowed)
  Historical: 0 (no violations)
  Platform: 5 (ManyVids permissive)
  Account: 10 (account in good standing)
  TOTAL: 10 × 0.5 + 0 × 0.25 + 5 × 0.15 + 10 × 0.1 = 6.75 (LOW RISK)

DECISION:
  OnlyFans: MANUAL REVIEW REQUIRED (medium risk)
  Fansly: AUTO-UPLOAD (low risk)
  ManyVids: AUTO-UPLOAD (low risk)
```

- AI learns your content style

**Content Removed by Platform:**
- Risk score for similar content increases
- Future similar uploads require manual review
- Alerts you to avoid similar content

**Example:**

```
Week 1: You upload BDSM video with "daddy" in caption to OnlyFans
  → Fanz risk score: 65 (medium risk)
  → Manual review: Approved
  → OnlyFans: Content stays up (no violation)
  → Risk score adjusted to 45 (learned that your "daddy" usage is okay)

Week 2: You upload similar BDSM video with "daddy" in caption
  → Fanz risk score: 45 (medium risk, but improved)
  → Manual review: Approved
  → OnlyFans: Content stays up
  → Risk score adjusted to 35 (learned again)

Week 3: You upload similar content
  → Fanz risk score: 35 (low risk)
  → AUTO-UPLOAD (no manual review needed)
```

---

## Best Practices for Successful Uploads

### Content Guidelines

**1. Verify All Performers**
- Solo content: You're already verified
- Collaborative content: Add and verify every performer before uploading
- Related: [2257 Compliance Guide](./2257-compliance.md)

**2. Avoid Prohibited Keywords**

**High-risk keywords to avoid:**
- **Incest-related:** "daddy/daughter", "mommy/son", "brother/sister", "step-", "family"
- **Age-related:** "teen", "barely legal", "18+", "young", "little girl"
- **Non-consent:** "forced", "rape", "drugged", "sleeping", "unwilling"
- **Minors:** "school girl" (use "schoolgirl fantasy" or "student roleplay" instead), "jailbait"

**Safe alternatives:**
- Instead of "daddy/daughter": "dominant/submissive", "older man/younger woman", "Sir"
- Instead of "barely legal": "young adult", "fresh face", "new to the scene"
- Instead of "forced": "rough", "intense", "aggressive" (with clear consent)

**3. Use Content Warnings Appropriately**
- BDSM, bondage: "Mature content, BDSM themes"
- Bodily fluids: "Extreme content warning" (for platforms that allow)
- Rough play: "Consensual rough play"

**4. Check Background/Setting**
- Remove weapons (guns, knives)
- Remove drug paraphernalia (bongs, pipes)
- Remove children's items (toys, school items in sexual context)
- Use neutral backgrounds or adult-themed decor

**5. Age Appearance Matters**
- Dress maturely (avoid pigtails, schoolgirl outfits unless clearly adult)
- Makeup and styling should appear adult
- Avoid "youthful" poses or behaviors in sexual contexts
- AI flags young-looking performers - appear confidently adult

---

### Caption & Description Best Practices

**DO:**
- Describe content clearly and accurately
- Use platform-appropriate language
- Include relevant tags (but avoid prohibited terms)
- Disclose any fetish/kink content upfront
- Use content warnings where appropriate

**DON'T:**
- Use prohibited keywords (see list above)
- Make age-related claims ("I'm 18", "just turned legal")
- Imply non-consent ("watch me get taken", "forced to")
- Reference family relationships
- Clickbait with violation terms

**Example - Bad Caption:**
```
"OMG daddy watch your little girl get forced by her stepdaddy in her school uniform 🥺👧"

Issues:
- "daddy", "little girl" → Age play + incest
- "forced" → Non-consent
- "stepdaddy" → Incest
- "school uniform" → Age play
- 👧 emoji → Minor implication
```

**Example - Good Caption:**
```
"Intense roleplay with dominant partner 🔥 Consensual rough play, mature themes. New video up now!"

Why it works:
- Clear adult roleplay context
- Explicit consent mentioned
- No prohibited keywords
- Accurate description
```

---

### Platform Selection Strategy

**Choose platforms based on your content:**

**Vanilla Solo Content (No Fetish):**
- ✅ OnlyFans (largest audience, highest earning potential)
- ✅ Fansly (good alternative, slightly smaller audience)
- ✅ Patreon (non-adult fans + adult tiers)

**BDSM, Fetish, Kink:**
- ⚠️ OnlyFans (risky, strict on some fetishes)
- ✅ Fansly (more permissive)
- ✅ ManyVids (most permissive)
- ✅ Clips4Sale (fetish-friendly)

**Roleplay, Pseudo-Incest, Taboo:**
- ❌ OnlyFans (will ban you)
- ⚠️ Fansly (risky)
- ✅ ManyVids (allows with warnings)

**Extreme Fetish (Watersports, etc.):**
- ❌ OnlyFans (prohibited)
- ⚠️ Fansly (allowed with warnings)
- ✅ ManyVids (allowed)

**Strategy:**
- Use OnlyFans for "safe" content (vanilla, mainstream)
- Use Fansly/ManyVids for edgier content
- Cross-promote: "More extreme content on my ManyVids"

---

### Technical Optimization

**Video Settings:**
- **Resolution:** 1080p minimum (4K for Fansly/ManyVids)
- **Codec:** H.264 (most compatible)
- **Bitrate:** 5-10 Mbps (higher quality, reasonable file size)
- **Length:** 5-20 minutes (longer content often has higher perceived value)

**Image Settings:**
- **Resolution:** 2000x3000 pixels minimum
- **Format:** JPEG (smaller files) or PNG (higher quality)
- **Thumbnail:** Create custom thumbnail (more clicks than auto-generated)

**File Size Limits:**

| Platform | Video Max Size | Image Max Size |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| OnlyFans | 5 GB | 50 MB |
| Fansly | 10 GB | 100 MB |
| Patreon | 2 GB | 25 MB |
| ManyVids | Unlimited | 50 MB |

**Fanz Dash Auto-Optimization:**
- Automatically compresses oversized files
- Converts to platform-required formats
- Generates optimized thumbnails
- Splits long videos if needed (OnlyFans 10-min limit)

---

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: Upload Blocked - High Risk Score

**Why it happens:**
- Content flagged for prohibited categories
- Keyword detected in caption/title
- High platform-specific risk (e.g., OnlyFans strict on certain content)

**What to do:**

1. **Check Notification Email**
   - Specific reason provided
   - Suggests changes (e.g., "Remove 'daddy' from caption")

2. **Make Changes**
   - Edit caption/description
   - Re-crop video if background issue
   - Change title/tags

3. **Resubmit**
   - Upload again with changes
   - Usually auto-approves after compliance edits

4. **If Still Blocked**
   - Contact support@fanz.com
   - May require manual review
   - Consider uploading to different platform (less strict)

---

### Issue: Content Uploaded but Removed by External Platform

**Why it happens:**
- Platform's AI flagged content after upload
- User reported content
- Manual platform review determined violation
- False positive (platform AI error)

**What to do:**

1. **Check Platform Notification**
   - Platform emails violation notice
   - Read specific reason

2. **Determine if Valid Violation**
   - **Valid:** Content actually violates platform rules
     - Don't re-upload same content
     - Update Fanz Dash settings to avoid future similar uploads
     - Consider different platform for this content type

   - **False Positive:** Content doesn't violate rules
     - Appeal to platform directly (use platform's appeal process)
     - Document appeal in Fanz Dash (helps future risk scoring)
     - If appeal denied, do not upload similar content again

3. **Update Fanz Dash**
   - Fanz Dash automatically detects removal
   - Risk score increased for similar content
   - You're alerted for future uploads of similar type

---

### Issue: Manual Review Taking Too Long

**Expected review times:**
- Standard: 2-12 hours
- High volume periods (Friday-Sunday): 12-24 hours
- Urgent review needed: Contact support

**What to do:**

1. **Check Status**
   - Dashboard: Compliance → Pending Reviews
   - Shows estimated review completion time

2. **If Urgent**
   - Email: compliance@fanz.com
   - Subject: "Urgent Review Request - [Upload ID]"
   - Explain urgency (e.g., scheduled post, time-sensitive promo)

3. **Expedited Review**
   - Available for verified creators with good standing
   - $25 expedite fee (reviewed within 1 hour)
   - Option presented during upload for medium-risk content

---

### Issue: All Performers Verified but Upload Still Blocked

**Why it happens:**
- Performer appears under 18 (AI age estimation false positive)
- Performer's verification expired (reverify every 12 months)
- New performer not added to this specific upload

**What to do:**

1. **Check Performer Verification Status**
   - Dashboard → Performers
   - Ensure all performers verified within last 12 months
   - Check expiration dates

2. **Re-Verify if Needed**
   - Performers must re-verify every year
   - Send re-verification request via dashboard
   - Upload held until re-verified

3. **Check Upload Performer List**
   - When uploading collaborative content, you must select which performers appear
   - If you forgot to add a performer, upload is blocked
   - Edit upload → Add missing performers → Resubmit

---

### Issue: OnlyFans Removed Content but It's Not Against Rules

**OnlyFans false positive (common issue):**

**Common False Positive Scenarios:**

1. **"Daddy" in Non-Incest Context**
   - Example: "Daddy doms me" (BDSM role, not family)
   - OnlyFans AI flags any "daddy" usage
   - Appeal: Explain BDSM context, not family roleplay

2. **Young-Looking but Verified 18+**
   - Performer looks under 18 but is verified adult
   - OnlyFans may remove anyway (appearance-based)
   - Appeal: Provide verification docs, explain adult age

3. **Background Item Flagged**
   - Weapon or drug paraphernalia visible in background
   - Not focus of content, but OnlyFans flags it
   - Appeal: Explain item not part of content, remove and re-upload

**How to Appeal to OnlyFans:**

1. **OnlyFans Appeals Process**
   - Email: complaints@onlyfans.com
   - Include: Content URL, explanation, evidence (verification docs)
   - Response time: 3-5 business days

2. **If Appeal Denied**
   - Do NOT re-upload same content (risk permanent ban)

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Platform Upload Strategy

**Fanz Dash allows different content per platform:**

**Example Strategy:**

**OnlyFans (Largest Audience, Strictest Rules):**
- Upload only "safe" content: Vanilla solo, no fetish, no risky keywords
- Goal: Build large subscriber base

**Fansly (Medium Audience, More Permissive):**
- Upload all OnlyFans content PLUS fetish content (BDSM, light roleplay)
- Goal: Serve fans who want edgier content

**ManyVids (Smaller Audience, Most Permissive):**
- Upload all Fansly content PLUS extreme fetish content
- Goal: High-paying niche audience

**Implementation:**
- Select platforms during upload
- Fanz Dash automatically assesses risk per platform
- May upload to Fansly/ManyVids while blocking OnlyFans (based on content)

---

### Scheduled Cross-Platform Releases

**Strategy: Stagger releases for maximum engagement:**

**Example:**
- **Monday 8pm:** Release on OnlyFans (vanilla edit)
- **Tuesday 8pm:** Release on Fansly (extended edit with fetish content)
- **Wednesday 8pm:** Release on ManyVids (full uncut version)

**Benefits:**
- Fans on all platforms feel exclusive access
- Drives cross-platform subscriptions ("Want full version? Check my ManyVids")
- Maximizes content value (same shoot, 3 different releases)

**Fanz Dash Scheduling:**
- Upload once to Fanz Dash
- Create 3 versions (edit in Fanz or upload separate files)
- Schedule each version to each platform
- Automatic posting, no manual work

---

### Geo-Restricted Content

**Some content legal in some countries, illegal in others:**

**Example: Cannabis Content**
- Legal in California, Colorado, Canada
- Illegal in many US states and countries
- Fansly allows with geo-restrictions

**Fanz Dash Geo-Restrictions:**
- Select allowed/blocked countries during upload
- Content only visible to fans in allowed locations
- Complies with local laws

**Common Use Cases:**
- Cannabis content (restricted to legal jurisdictions)
- Certain fetishes (legal in some countries, not others)
- Extreme content (available in permissive countries only)

## FAQ for Creators

### Do I need to manually upload to each platform, or does Fanz Dash do it?

**Fanz Dash does it automatically.** You upload once to Fanz Dash, select which platforms, and Fanz uploads to all selected platforms. You receive confirmation for each successful upload.

---

### Can I edit content after it's uploaded to external platforms?

**No, not directly through Fanz Dash.** Once uploaded to external platforms, edits must be made on the platform itself. You can re-upload a new version through Fanz Dash, but the original post remains on the platform until you manually delete it.

---

### What if I want to upload to OnlyFans myself (not through Fanz)?

**You can do both.** Fanz Dash links to your external accounts but doesn't prevent manual uploads. However, ALL content uploaded through Fanz (even if you later manually upload elsewhere) is screened for compliance.

**Recommendation:** Use Fanz Dash for all uploads to benefit from compliance screening (protects you from accidental violations).

---

### If content is blocked for OnlyFans, can I still upload to Fansly?

**Yes.** Fanz Dash assesses risk separately for each platform. Content blocked for OnlyFans (strict) may be approved for Fansly (less strict) or ManyVids (most permissive).

---

### How do I know if my content was removed from an external platform?

**Fanz Dash alerts you:**
- Email notification when content removed
- Dashboard shows removal status
- Reason provided (if platform specifies)

**Check daily:** Dashboard → External Platforms → Removed Content

---

### Can I appeal if Fanz Dash blocks my upload?

**Yes.** Reply to the block notification email with your explanation. Senior compliance officer reviews within 48 hours. If appeal approved, content is uploaded. If denied, explanation provided.

---

### Does Fanz Dash charge extra for multi-platform uploads?

**No additional fees.** Multi-platform upload included in Fanz Dash subscription. You only pay external platform fees (e.g., OnlyFans 20% commission).

---

### What happens if I get banned from OnlyFans? Can I still use Fanz Dash?

**Yes.** Fanz Dash supports multiple platforms. If banned from one platform, you can continue uploading to others. Fanz Dash can help you transition to alternative platforms.
