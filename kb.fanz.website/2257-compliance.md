## Legal Authority

### 18 U.S.C. § 2257 - Record Keeping Requirements

**Full Title:** "Record keeping requirements for producers of actual sexually explicit material"

**Enacted:** 1988 (Child Protection and Obscenity Enforcement Act)
**Amended:** 2006 (Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act)

**Purpose:** Ensure no minors appear in sexually explicit content by requiring proof of age for all performers.

---

### What Is "Sexually Explicit Content"?

**18 U.S.C. § 2257(h)(2) defines "sexually explicit conduct":**

1. **Sexual intercourse** (including genital-genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, oral-anal)
2. **Bestiality**
3. **Masturbation**
4. **Sadistic or masochistic abuse** (in sexual context)
5. **Lascivious exhibition of the genitals or pubic area**

**Important:** "Lascivious exhibition" is broad - includes content where genitals/pubic area are the focus, even if no sexual act is occurring.

---

### What Is NOT Covered (Exempt)

**Content NOT requiring 2257 compliance:**

1. **Non-sexual nudity**
   - Artistic nude photography (clearly not sexual)
   - Medical/educational content
   - Example: Classical nude art, medical textbooks

2. **Simulated sexual content (no real people)**

4. **Non-commercial content (limited exemption)**
   - Personal content not distributed commercially
   - Example: Private photos sent to partner (not posted publicly)
   - **Warning:** If you later monetize, 2257 applies retroactively

---

## Who Must Comply?

### Primary Producer

**"Primary Producer" = Person who actually creates the content**

**Examples:**
- Solo creator filming yourself → You are primary producer
- Photographer shooting models → Photographer is primary producer

- Couple filming together → Both are primary producers

**Responsibilities:**
- Verify age of all performers (yourself included)
- Create and maintain 2257 records
- Make records available to FBI upon request
- Designate Custodian of Records

---

### Secondary Producer

**"Secondary Producer" = Person who duplicates, publishes, or distributes content for commercial purposes**

- DVD manufacturer pressing discs → Secondary producer

**Responsibilities:**
- Obtain statement from primary producer that 2257 records exist

## Content Production Records

### What Content Requires Records?

**ALL sexually explicit content you produce, including:**

- Videos (solo, collaborative)
- Photos (solo, collaborative)
- Live streams (recorded or unrecorded)
- Custom content (commissioned by fans)
- Deleted content (records still required for 7 years)

**Content Information to Record:**

**For Each Piece of Content:**
- Title or description
- Production date (when filmed/photographed)
- Publication date (when first published)
- Where published (URLs, platforms)
- All performers appearing (names, time segments they appear)
- Duration (for videos)

**Example Content Record:**

```
Content ID: video_001
Title: "Solo Video - December 2024"
Production Date: December 20, 2024
Publication Date: December 23, 2024

## Common Mistakes & How to Avoid

### Mistake #1: Not Keeping Records for Solo Content

**Wrong:** "I'm filming myself, I know I'm 18+, so I don't need records."

**Correct:** Federal law requires records even for solo content. You must maintain copy of your ID, date of birth, and list of all content you produce.

**How to Fix:** Immediately create 2257 records for yourself. Use Fanz Dash's system or create your own.

---

### Mistake #2: Not Verifying Collaborators

**Wrong:** "My friend says they're 18+, I trust them, no need to verify."

**Correct:** You MUST verify age with government-issued ID for ALL performers. Verbal confirmation is not sufficient.

**How to Fix:** Before filming with anyone, get copy of their ID, verify age, have them sign model release.

---

### Mistake #3: Deleting Records After Content Removal

**Wrong:** "I deleted the video, so I can delete the records too."

**Correct:** Records must be kept for 7 years AFTER content is removed. If content is still available anywhere (even on other platforms), records must be kept indefinitely.

**How to Fix:** Keep all records for at least 7 years after permanent removal. If unsure, keep indefinitely.

---

### Mistake #4: Not Updating Records for Name Changes

**Wrong:** Performer changes stage name, you don't update records.

**Correct:** Any name changes (legal name or stage name) must be updated in records with documentation.

**How to Fix:** If performer changes name, update records with new name, add old name to "aliases", document date of change.

---

### Mistake #5: Not Listing Custodian of Records

**Wrong:** Not displaying 2257 statement on content.

**Correct:** ALL sexually explicit content must have 2257 statement showing Custodian name and address.

**How to Fix:** Add 2257 statement to all content. Fanz Dash does this automatically if you use our Custodian service.

---

## FAQ

### Do I need 2257 records if I only post on Fanz Dash (not other platforms)?

**Yes.** Federal law applies regardless of platform. If you produce sexually explicit content, you need 2257 records.

---

### What if a performer refuses to provide their ID?

**Do NOT film with them.** If you cannot verify their age, you cannot legally produce content with them. It's not worth the risk (federal crime if they're under 18).

---

### Can I use a P.O. Box for Custodian address?

**Technically yes, but FBI must be able to inspect records.** P.O. Box is acceptable only if you're available for in-person inspection. If FBI shows up and you're not there, you're in violation.

**Better:** Use Fanz Dash's Custodian service (we're always available).

---

### What if I filmed content years ago and didn't keep records?

**Recreate records immediately.** Contact all performers, get copies of their IDs (even years later), document everything. If you cannot locate performers, document your attempts. Content should be removed until records are complete.

---

### Do I need 2257 records for content I bought/licensed from someone else?

**As secondary producer, yes, but in limited form.** You need:
- Statement from primary producer that 2257 records exist
- Name and address of primary producer's Custodian of Records

You do NOT need copies of actual records (primary producer maintains those).

---

### What happens if FBI inspection finds a violation?

**Depends on severity:**

**Minor Violation (e.g., disorganized records, but all present):**
- Warning, order to fix within 30 days
- Follow-up inspection to verify compliance

**Serious Violation (e.g., missing records for some performers):**
- Criminal charges possible
- Content removed
- Platform bans

**Severe Violation (e.g., no records, minor found in content):**
- Federal charges (2257 + production of CSAM)
- Imprisonment likely

**Compliance Is Mandatory:** If you produce sexually explicit content, you MUST comply with 18 U.S.C. § 2257. Fanz Dash provides tools to help you comply, but you are ultimately responsible for maintaining accurate records. When in doubt, consult with legal counsel or use Fanz Dash's Custodian of Records service.
