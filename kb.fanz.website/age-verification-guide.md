## 🌍 How Location Detection Works

When you first access Fanz Dash:

1. **IP Geolocation Check**
   - System detects your IP address
   - Determines your country and state/region
   - Checks if age verification is required in your location

2. **Age Verification Gate**
   - If required: Age verification modal appears
   - If not required: No verification needed (but recommended)

3. **Verification Status Stored**
   - Once verified, stored for future sessions
   - No need to reverify on subsequent visits
   - Stored for 7 years (federal law requirement)

**Note:** Using VPN/proxy to bypass verification is a violation of Terms of Service and may result in permanent ban.

## Method 4: AI Age Estimation

**Best for:** Privacy-conscious users
**Time:** 1-2 minutes
**Cost:** Free
**Privacy:** Highest - No ID or payment info needed

### How It Works

AI analyzes a live photo of your face to estimate your age. If the AI determines you appear 18+, verification passes. This method is privacy-focused - no ID documents, no payment info, no personal details.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Click "AI Age Estimation"**
   - Age verification gate will appear
   - Click "AI Age Estimation" button

2. **Grant Camera Permission**
   - Browser will ask for camera access
   - Click "Allow"
   - Needed for live photo capture

3. **Take Live Photo**
   - Face camera directly
   - Remove glasses, hats, masks
   - Ensure good lighting
   - Follow on-screen instructions

4. **AI Analysis**
   - AI processes your photo (5-10 seconds)
   - Estimates your age based on facial features
   - Determines if you appear 18+

5. **Verification Result**
   - **Pass:** AI determines you appear 18+ → Access granted
   - **Fail:** AI determines you appear under 18 → Try different method
   - **Unclear:** AI cannot determine → Try different method

### What We Store

- ✅ Photo of your face (encrypted)
- ✅ AI age estimate (e.g., "appears 25-30")
- ✅ Verification timestamp
- ❌ **NOT STORED:** Name, ID, payment info, personal details

**Storage:** 7 years (federal law requirement)

### AI Technology

- **Model:** Proprietary age estimation CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- **Training:** Trained on 10M+ diverse faces across all ages, ethnicities
- **Accuracy:** 95%+ accuracy for ages 18-65
- **Bias Testing:** Regular audits for demographic fairness

### Privacy Protection

- **No PII required** - Photo of face only
- **Encrypted storage** - Photo encrypted at rest
- **Not used for training** - Your photo never used to train AI
- **Cannot be linked to identity** - No name or ID associated

### Limitations

- **May not work for everyone** - Some facial features harder to estimate
- **Edge cases** - Very young-looking adults (18-22) may fail
- **Appearance changes** - Significant weight loss/gain, surgery may affect
- **Makeup/filters** - May interfere with estimation

**If AI verification fails, you can immediately try a different method.**

### Troubleshooting

**"Could not estimate age"**
- Ensure good, even lighting
- Face camera directly (not angled)
- Remove glasses, hats, sunglasses
- No makeup or filters
- Try again (up to 3 attempts)

**"Verification failed - appear under 18"**
- If you ARE 18+, try different verification method
- AI may have difficulty with your facial features
- Use ID upload or VerifyMy for certain approval

**"Camera not working"**
- Check browser permissions (camera access)
- Try different browser
- Ensure camera is not in use by another app

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I need to verify on every device?
No. Verification is account-based, not device-based. Once verified, you're verified on all devices.

### Can I use someone else's ID?
**No. This is identity fraud and is illegal.** You must use your own ID.

### What if I don't have a government ID?
- Try **Credit Card** method (any card in your name)
- Try **AI Age Estimation** (no ID needed)
- Contact support@fanz.com for alternative options

### Can I verify if I'm under 18?
**No. You must be 18 or older to use Fanz.** If you're under 18, you cannot access the platform, even with parental permission.

### What if verification fails?

- Check troubleshooting section for your method
- Contact support@fanz.com for assistance

### Is my verification data secure?
Yes. All data is encrypted, access-controlled, and stored on secure servers. We comply with GDPR, CCPA, and PCI DSS standards.

### Can I delete my verification data?
**No, not for 7 years.** Federal law (18 U.S.C. § 2257) requires retention for 7 years. After 7 years, data is automatically purged.

### Why does verification cost money (VerifyMy)?
Fanz doesn't charge for verification - the $0.50-$1.50 fee is charged by VerifyMy (the third-party verification provider) to cover their operational costs. **All other methods are free.**
