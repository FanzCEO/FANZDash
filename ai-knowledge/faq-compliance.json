      "question": "What is compliance and why does it matter?",
      "answer": "Compliance means following laws and regulations that apply to adult content platforms. It matters because non-compliance can result in platform shutdown, criminal charges (up to 20 years imprisonment for CSAM violations), multi-million dollar fines (up to 18M in UK, 20M EUR in EU), and payment processor termination. Compliance protects users, creators, and the platform.",

      "answer": "Yes, some laws apply directly to users. Creating or uploading CSAM is a federal crime. Creators must maintain 2257 records.

      "answer": "18 U.S.C. 2257 is the federal record-keeping requirement for sexually explicit content. It requires maintaining: performer legal name, date of birth, copy of valid ID at time of production, all stage names/aliases used, and records of where content appears.

This includes: criminal liability for CSAM (federal crime), civil liability for non-consensual content, violation of 2257 if you don't maintain records, potential trafficking charges if you're involved in exploitation.

It prohibits 9 content categories: CSAM, content appearing to depict minors, incest (including roleplay), bestiality, non-consensual content, necrophilia, excrement, extreme violence, and trafficking.

      "question": "What happens if we lose payment processing?",
      "answer": "Losing payment processor relationships would be catastrophic: inability to process credit card payments, loss of revenue for creators, potential platform shutdown, difficulty finding alternative processors (industry blacklisting).

Second violation: 7-day suspension + content removal + mandatory training. Third violation: Permanent ban. However, some violations (CSAM, severe trafficking indicators) result in immediate permanent ban. All removals include a Statement of Reasons and appeal option (except CSAM).",

      "answer": "Moving content between Fanz platforms (e.g., from boyfanz to transfanz): content retains compliance status, verification transfers via FanzSSO, no re-upload needed for SSO-linked accounts, compliance score follows your account. Moving from external platforms to Fanz: must re-verify all performers, content goes through normal review, external compliance doesn't transfer.",
