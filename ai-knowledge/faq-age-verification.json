      "question": "Why do I need to verify my age?",
      "answer": "Age verification is required by law in the UK (Online Safety Act 2023), 8 US states (Louisiana, Utah, Virginia, Texas, Arkansas, Mississippi, Montana, Kansas), and various EU countries. These laws require adult content platforms to verify users are 18+ before granting access. Fanz uses IP geolocation to determine if verification is required based on your location.",

VerifyMy is also privacy-oriented: third-party processing, Fanz only receives yes/no verification. ID upload stores data but with encryption.

Benefits: independent processing (Fanz doesn't see your ID), multiple verification options, widely accepted, and fast processing. Cost is $0.50-$1.50 depending on region and method.",

      "answer": "AI age estimation analyzes facial features to estimate age without identifying you. Process: (1) Take a live selfie, (2) AI analyzes facial features (not identity), (3) Estimates if you're over 18, (4) Result returned (pass/fail). No images are stored after processing.

      "question": "Is AI age estimation accurate?",
      "answer": "AI age estimation is highly accurate for clearly adult faces (25+): 95%+ accuracy. For ages 18-24, accuracy is lower (85-90%) due to facial similarity between teens and young adults. If AI estimation fails or is uncertain, you'll be asked to use an alternative method. This protects against false positives while maintaining privacy for most users.",

      "answer": "AI estimation can produce false negatives (incorrectly estimating under 18). If this happens: (1) Don't worry - it doesn't mean you're banned, (2) Use an alternative verification method (ID upload or credit card), (3) AI will offer alternatives automatically, (4) Your accurate age will be confirmed by document/payment.

      "answer": "Passports from most countries are accepted. Requirements: valid (not expired), from a recognized country, readable with clear photo. Some countries' passports may require additional verification due to document security variations. If your passport isn't accepted, try another document type or verification method.",
