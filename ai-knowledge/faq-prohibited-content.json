      "question": "Why is incest roleplay prohibited?",
      "answer": "Payment processors (Visa/Mastercard) ban ALL incest content, including roleplay and fantasy scenarios. Reasons: high chargeback rates, reputational risk, and legal concerns in many jurisdictions. Even with all participants verified adults 18+, incest-themed content is prohibited. This includes step-family scenarios and any familial relationship references in sexual context.",

      "answer": "Prohibited incest content includes: biological family relationships, step-family relationships, adopted family relationships, in-law relationships, any familial terms (mom, dad, brother, sister, etc.) in sexual context, family roleplay scenarios, and 'family' fantasies regardless of actual relationships. Text, audio, titles, tags, and visual content are all included.",

      "question": "Can I use step-family terminology if we're not actually related?",
      "answer": "No. The prohibition is on the content/framing, not actual relationships. Using step-family terminology, titles like 'Step-mom teaches...', or familial roleplay is prohibited regardless of whether performers are actually related. Payment processors prohibit any incest theme - there are no loopholes.",

      "answer": "Barely legal content emphasizes youth/just turning 18 in a sexual context. It is PROHIBITED. This includes: '18th birthday' sexual themes, 'just legal' framing, emphasis on youth/innocence, 'teen' in sexual titles (even if performer is 18+). Payment processors ban this as it creates CSAM-adjacent content and normalizes interest in minors.",

      "answer": "No, 'teen' is prohibited in sexual content titles, descriptions, and tags even if the performer is 18+. The term emphasizes youth in sexual context, which payment processors and many laws prohibit. Use 'young adult', 'college', or simply don't reference age. 18+ doesn't make youth-focused sexual content acceptable.",

      "question": "Why are school uniforms prohibited in sexual content?",
      "answer": "School uniforms suggest minors (students are typically under 18). Sexual content featuring school uniforms is prohibited because: it creates association between sexual content and minors, many jurisdictions criminalize this as pseudo-CSAM, and payment processors explicitly ban it. College apparel may be acceptable with clear adult context.",

This includes: acting/speaking like a child, using child-like items (diapers, bottles, pacifiers) in sexual context, 'daddy/little' dynamics that suggest minor, and any scenario suggesting a participant is under 18.

      "answer": "Context matters. Stuffed animals/props are fine in non-sexual context. In sexual content: if props suggest childishness or innocence in sexual context, they're prohibited. If clearly adult context (plushies in bedroom as decor, not integral to sexual scenario), typically allowed. When in doubt, remove props that could suggest minor/innocent framing.",

      "answer": "CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) is any visual depiction of sexually explicit conduct involving a minor (under 18). This includes: photos, videos, computer-generated images, and AI-generated content depicting minors. CSAM is a federal crime (18 U.S.C. 2251-2260) with 15-30 year sentences.

      "answer": "Yes. AI-generated CSAM is illegal under 18 U.S.C. 1466A and many state laws. Creating realistic images depicting minors in sexual situations - whether real or AI-generated - is a federal crime. Detection and reporting procedures are the same as for real CSAM.
